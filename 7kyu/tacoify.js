// If you like Taco Bell, you will be familiar with their signature doritos locos taco. They're very good.

// Why can't everything be a taco? We're going to attempt that here, turning every word we find into the taco bell recipe with each ingredient.

// We want to input a word as a string, and return a list representing that word as a taco.

// Key

// all vowels (except 'y') = beef

// t = tomato

// l = lettuce

// c = cheese

// g = guacamole

// s = salsa

// NOTE
// We do not care about case here. 'S' is therefore equivalent to 's' in our taco.

// Ignore all other letters; we don't want our taco uneccesarily clustered or else it will be too difficult to eat.

// Note that no matter what ingredients are passed, our taco will always have a shell.
